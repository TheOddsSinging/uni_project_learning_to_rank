# uni_project_learning_to_rank
The purpose of this project is to find a ranking model to estimate the relevance between query-document pairs. In this submission, the function used to score each query-document pair is the feedforward neural network model. The loss function used to optimise the scoring function is listwise loss function. The model is built, trained, and evaluated with the python library of Tensorflow and Tensorflow Ranking.

The architecture of the ranking model used for this project is adapted from the architecture showed in the tutorial for Tensorflow Ranking library (Github Tensorflow Ranking, 2021).
